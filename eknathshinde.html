            </div>
            <p class="image-p">Eknath Shinde is the man credited with altering the political landscape in Maharashtra.
                Shinde ji has been a meteoric rise - from humble beginnings to being in charge of one of the most
                significant states of India. Eknath Shinde Ji is an Indian politician and the current Minister of State
                for Home Affairs in the Government of India. Shinde Ji is a member of the Shiv Sena, a right-wing Hindu
                nationalist party based in the state of Maharashtra. The 58-year-old was elected to the Maharashtra
                Assembly for four consecutive terms in 2004, 2009, 2014, and 2019, and has been in charge of planning
                major Shiv Sena gatherings. Following his victory in 2014, Shinde, the most popular leader was chosen to
                represent the Shiv Sena legislative party. He later served as the Leader of Opposition in the
                Maharashtra Assembly for a short time. In the Sena-BJP government, he was appointed PWD minister. On
                30th June 2022, Eknath Shinde was sworn in as the 20th Chief Minister of Maharashtra. Shinde ji was
                introduced to politics by then Thane Shiv Sena President Anand Dighe in early 1980 and became successor
                to the latters legacy after his death in 2001. He rose through the ranks after launching a labour union
                for the party. His position in the Shiv Sena became stronger after Bal Thackerays nephew Raj left the
                party and launched Maharashtra Navnirman Sena.</p>

            <h1>Humble Beginnings</h1>
            <p>
                Eknath Shinde is a Maratha who was born in the Jawali taluka of Satara, Maharashtra in 9 February 1964.
                His family relocated to Thane, on Mumbais outskirts, in order to make a living. Eknath attended Mangala
                High School & Junior College in Thane until the 11th grade. After completing his education, Shinde Ji
                began working in the accounts department of the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai. He later joined
                the Shiv Sena, a party founded by his uncle Bal Thackeray, and quickly rose through the ranks to become
                one of its senior leaders.
            </p>
            <h1>Eknath Shinde Birth, Education, and Family</h1>
            <p>Shinde ji married Lata, a strong and intelligent woman who has stood by him through thick and thin. They
                had 3 children, a son named Shrikant, another son named Deepesh, and a daughter named Shubhada. In a
                tragic accident in 2000, while they were on a holiday, the Shinde family lost the younger children
                Deepesh and Shubhada when they drowned in a lake as their boat capsized. Their surviving son Shrikant is
                an Orthopaedic Surgeon and an elected Lok Sabha member from the Kalyan constituency since 2014. Shrikant
                married Vrushali in 2016 and they have one child Rudransh.</p>
            <h1>Eknath Shinde ji Political Career</h1>
            <p>His first key political position was as a corporate of Thane Municipal Corporation in 1997. 2004 he was
                first elected to the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly and appointed the Shiv Sena Thane Head in 2005. He
                continued his position as an MLA for 4 consecutive terms, serving as Minister of Public Works, Minister
                of Public Health and Family Welfare, Minister of Urban Development and Public Works, and Minister of
                Home Affairs. Eknath Shinde is a true Shiv Sainik who was distraught by the unnatural political alliance
                that Shiv Sena sought in Maharashtra. Shinde successfully re-established an alliance with BJP and was
                sworn in as the 20th Chief Minister, with Bharatiya Janata Partys Devendra Fadnavis as the Deputy Chief
                Minister. In 2022, he was one of the most searched politicians on Google. He was awarded the Lokmat
                Maharashtrian of the Year award in 2022 to commemorate and salute his phenomenal work over the years.
                His journey has been a testament to the excellent impact that he has had in promoting Maharashtra on a
                national and global scale.</p>
            <h1>Public Service</h1>
            <p>Since his youth days, Shinde was inspired by the ideology of Balasaheb Thackeray. He entered politics in
                the 1980s when he joined Shiv Sena as a Sainik, introduced by Anand Dighe, his mentor and a senior
                leader in the party. Shinde, under Dighes leadership, emerged as a street-smart leader and problem
                solver. He participated in various agitations, including the Maharashtra-Karnataka border agitation when
                he was arrested and imprisoned for 40 days. His rise surprised many because of his enthusiasm,
                dedication, and preparedness to convert a crisis into an opportunity. Dighe was impressed by Shindes
                work and brought him into electoral politics by giving him a party ticket in 1997.
