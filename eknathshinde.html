          <p class="content">Eknath Shinde is the man credited with altering the political landscape in
            Maharashtra.
            Shinde ji has been a meteoric rise - from humble beginnings to being in charge of one of the most
            significant states of India. Eknath Shinde Ji is an Indian politician and the current Minister of
            State
            for Home Affairs in the Government of India. Shinde Ji is a member of the Shiv Sena, a right-wing
            Hindu
            nationalist party based in the state of Maharashtra. The 58-year-old was elected to the Maharashtra
            Assembly for four consecutive terms in 2004, 2009, 2014, and 2019, and has been in charge of
            planning
            major Shiv Sena gatherings. Following his victory in 2014, Shinde, the most popular leader was
            chosen to
            represent the Shiv Sena legislative party. He later served as the Leader of Opposition in the
            Maharashtra Assembly for a short time. In the Sena-BJP government, he was appointed PWD minister. On
            30th June 2022, Eknath Shinde was sworn in as the 20th Chief Minister of Maharashtra. Shinde ji was
            introduced to politics by then Thane Shiv Sena President Anand Dighe in early 1980 and became
            successor
            to the latters legacy after his death in 2001. He rose through the ranks after launching a labour
            union
            for the party. His position in the Shiv Sena became stronger after Bal Thackerays nephew Raj left
            the
            party and launched Maharashtra Navnirman Sena.</p>
          <h3 class="title-text">Humble Beginnings</h3>
          <p class="content">Eknath Shinde is a Maratha who was born in the Jawali taluka of Satara, Maharashtra
            in 9 February 1964.
            His family relocated to Thane, on Mumbais outskirts, in order to make a living. Eknath attended
            Mangala
            High School & Junior College in Thane until the 11th grade. After completing his education, Shinde
            Ji
            began working in the accounts department of the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai. He later
            joined
            the Shiv Sena, a party founded by his uncle Bal Thackeray, and quickly rose through the ranks to
            become
            one of its senior leaders.</p>
          <p class="content">Shinde ji married Lata, a strong and intelligent woman who has stood by him through
            thick and thin. They
            had 3 children, a son named Shrikant, another son named Deepesh, and a daughter named Shubhada. In a
            tragic accident in 2000, while they were on a holiday, the Shinde family lost the younger children
            Deepesh and Shubhada when they drowned in a lake as their boat capsized. Their surviving son
            Shrikant is
            an Orthopaedic Surgeon and an elected Lok Sabha member from the Kalyan constituency since 2014.
            Shrikant
            married Vrushali in 2016 and they have one child Rudransh.</p>
          <h3 class="title-text">Eknath Shinde ji Political Career</h3>
          <p class="content">His first key political position was as a corporate of Thane Municipal Corporation in
            1997. 2004 he was
            first elected to the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly and appointed the Shiv Sena Thane Head in
            2005. He
            continued his position as an MLA for 4 consecutive terms, serving as Minister of Public Works,
            Minister
            of Public Health and Family Welfare, Minister of Urban Development and Public Works, and Minister of
            Home Affairs. Eknath Shinde is a true Shiv Sainik who was distraught by the unnatural political
            alliance
            that Shiv Sena sought in Maharashtra. Shinde successfully re-established an alliance with BJP and
            was
            sworn in as the 20th Chief Minister, with Bharatiya Janata Partys Devendra Fadnavis as the Deputy
            Chief
            Minister. In 2022, he was one of the most searched politicians on Google. He was awarded the Lokmat
            Maharashtrian of the Year award in 2022 to commemorate and salute his phenomenal work over the
            years.
            His journey has been a testament to the excellent impact that he has had in promoting Maharashtra on
            a
            national and global scale.</p>
          <h3 class="title-text">Public Service</h3>
          <p class="content">Since his youth days, Shinde was inspired by the ideology of Balasaheb Thackeray. He
            entered politics in
            the 1980s when he joined Shiv Sena as a Sainik, introduced by Anand Dighe, his mentor and a senior
            leader in the party. Shinde, under Dighes leadership, emerged as a street-smart leader and problem
            solver. He participated in various agitations, including the Maharashtra-Karnataka border agitation
            when
            he was arrested and imprisoned for 40 days. His rise surprised many because of his enthusiasm,
            dedication, and preparedness to convert a crisis into an opportunity. Dighe was impressed by Shindes
            work and brought him into electoral politics by giving him a party ticket in 1997.
