                also known as Balasaheb, was the driving force behind the establishment and growth of Shiv Sena. He
                founded the party on June 19, 1966, with the objective of advocating for the rights and welfare of the

                and strong personality, which resonated with a large section of the population, particularly in

                Hindu nationalist party. The party focused on promoting Marathi culture, language, and the interests of
                the local population. Balasaheb's leadership style was characterized by his powerful oratory skills,
                assertive stance on regional issues, and his ability to mobilize mass support. He was often regarded as
                a strong advocate for the rights of the common people and a voice for the marginalized sections of
                society. During his tenure as the leader of Shiv Sena, Balasaheb influenced the party's political
                strategy, organizational structure, and ideology. He played a pivotal role in shaping Shiv Sena's
                approach to politics, which included street activism, protests, and an aggressive style of politics.</p>
