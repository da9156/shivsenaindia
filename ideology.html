                    <p class="content">Shiv Sena was founded in 1966 by Balasaheb Thackeray with the aim of championing
                        the rights
                        and aspirations of the Marathi-speaking population in Maharashtra. It emerged as a regional
                        force committed to addressing the concerns of the Marathi manoos (people) and promoting their
                        socio-cultural identity. Over the years, Shiv Sena has evolved and expanded its scope to
                        encompass a broader ideology focused on inclusive development and governance.

                    <p class="content"><strong>Regional Identity and Empowerment</strong><br>
                        One of the core principles of Shiv Sena is the preservation and promotion of
                        Maharashtra's
                        regional identity. The party believes in safeguarding the interests of the Marathi-speaking
                        population and ensuring their rightful representation in various spheres of life. Shiv Sena
                        advocates for the empowerment of Maharashtra and its people, striving to create a sense of
                        pride and unity among its residents.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content"><strong>Social Justice and Welfare
                        </strong><br>
                        Shiv Sena is committed to social justice and endeavors to bridge the gaps between different
                        sections of society. The party emphasizes the welfare of marginalized communities, addressing
                        their needs, and creating opportunities for their upliftment. Shiv Sena's ideology promotes
                        inclusive growth, where every individual, regardless of their background, has access to
                        education, healthcare, and basic amenities.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content"><strong>Regional Development and Infrastructure
                        </strong>Shiv Sena recognizes the importance of sustainable development and infrastructure in
                        driving
                        economic growth and improving the quality of life for the people of Maharashtra. The party
                        focuses on the development of industries, agriculture, and tourism sectors, with an aim to

                        employment opportunities and boost the state's economy. Additionally, Shiv Sena advocates for
                        the improvement of infrastructure, including transportation networks, urban planning, and

                    <p class="content"><strong>Secularism and Social Harmony</strong>While Shiv Sena has its roots in
                        regionalism, the party strongly upholds the principles of
                        secularism and social harmony. It promotes mutual respect, understanding, and peaceful
                        coexistence among people from diverse religious and cultural backgrounds. Shiv Sena strives to
                        build an inclusive society where individuals from all faiths can thrive and contribute to the
                        progress of Maharashtra.
